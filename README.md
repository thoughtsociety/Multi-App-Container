A fork of 
https://github.com/ericcgu/Flask_Dash_Container

Added extra items to requirements.txt in order to get this to correctly build and run.
Demos a sample StockTicker app (renamed app.py) which originated 
on [Jose Portilla's Dash course in Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/interactive-python-dashboards-with-plotly-and-dash/learn/v4/overview).

## Multi-App-Container 

09/29/18 - Re-forked Ctindel's mods and deleted the current repo

This is essentially a fork of the Stock Ticker with two apps now. Second one is Eric's simple graph.

Added second container for the app1 called "dash1" in the docker-compose.yml.

    dash1:
        container_name: dash1
        restart: always
        build: ./dash1
        ports:
        - "8500:8500"
        command: gunicorn -w 1 -b :8500 app1:server
